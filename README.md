# QuickManifest


## About:
Because there isn't a quick way to get unix time on windows, this exe will quickly generate a manifest.json file for .ankiaddon packaging.


## Usage:
```
quick_manifest.exe "Addon Name" "addon_package" >manifest.json
```

```
quick_manifest.exe "Hoochie Papa: NewQ" "hoochie_papa" >manifest.json
```
